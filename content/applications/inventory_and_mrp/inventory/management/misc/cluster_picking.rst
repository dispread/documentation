Cluster picking
===============

.. |SOS| replace:: :abbr:`SOs (Sales Orders)`

Cluster picking is an advanced order fulfillment approached derived from :ref:`batch picking
<inventory/misc/batch_picking>`. In this strategy, pickers load a cart with multiple packages, each
designated for specific a sales order (SO). Then, the picker travels to each storage location and
places the products directly in the package related to the customer order.

This method is most efficient for medium-sized companies with high order volumes and few different
products, since the method eliminates the need for sorting products into packages for customers
after picking. Disadvantages of cluster picking are that urgent orders cannot be prioritized and
optimized batches must be manually created beforehand, so the picking process can lead to
bottlenecks.

.. _inventory/misc/cluster_picking/example:

.. example::
   #. |SO| 1 calls for one apple and orange
   #. |SO| 2 requires one apple and banana
   #. |SO| 3 needs one apple, orange, and banana

   Apples are stored in Shelf A, oranges in Shelf B, and bananas in Shelf C.

   To pick products for three orders at once, the cart is loaded with three empty packages.

   Starting at Shelf A, the the picker places apples into each package. Next, the picker navigates
   to Shelf B and places oranges in the packages designated for |SO| 1 and |SO| 3. Finally, the
   picker pushes the cart to Shelf C and loads packages for |SO| 2 and |SO| 3 with a banana, each.

   With all three |SOS| fulfilled, the picker pushes the cart to the output location, where
   the packages are sealed and prepared for shipment.

Configuration
=============

To enable cluster picking, begin by navigating to :menuselection:`Inventory app --> Configuration
--> Settings`. Under the :guilabel:`Operations` heading, activate the :guilabel:`Packages` and
:guilabel:`Batch Transfers` options.

.. image:: cluster_picking/configs.png
   :align: center
   :alt: Activate *Packages* and *Batch Transfers* features in the settings.

Since batch picking is a method to optimize the *pick* operation in Odoo, the :guilabel:`Storage
Locations` and :guilabel:`Multi-Step Routes` options under the :guilabel:`Warehouse` heading must
also be checked on this settings page. When finished, click :guilabel:`Save`.

Packages setup
--------------

After the :guilabel:`Packages` feature is enabled, set up the packages before the picking, in the
:menuselection:`Inventory app --> Products --> Packages` page. Click the :guilabel:`New` button to
create a new package.

On the package form for creating a new package, the :guilabel:`Package Reference` is pre-filled to
the next available `PACK` number in the system. :guilabel:`Pack Date` is automatically set to the
creation date of the form.

For the :guilabel:`Package Use` field, the :guilabel:`Disposable Box` radio option should be
selected if the package is a shipping container. On the contrary, the :guilabel:`Reusable Box`
option should be selected if the package is simply used as a method of grouping products from the
same |SO| together and the products are intended to be moved to the intended shipping container at
the output location.

.. seealso::
   :ref:`Packages <inventory/management/packages>`

.. example::
   A package intended for cluster picking is named `CLUSTER-PACK-3` for easy identification. For
   this workflow, the products are directly packed using their intended shipping containers, so
   :guilabel:`Package Use` is set to :guilabel:`Disposable Box`.

Create cluster batch
====================

To see how cluster picking works in Odoo, navigate to the *Sales* app and create |SOS| that will be
fulfilled together in the same batch. After confirming the |SO|, the :guilabel:`Delivery` smart
button becomes visible. Displayed inside the icon is a number representing the amount of steps in
the outgoing shipment process.

.. example::
   Begin by creating three |SOS| for the apples, oranges, and bananas as shown in the :ref:`example
   above <inventory/misc/cluster_picking/example>`.

   After confirming the |SO|, the :guilabel:`Delivery` smart button will be shown with the number
   `2`, indicating that there are two operations to complete: `Pick` and `Delivery`.

   .. image:: cluster_picking/create-sales-order.png
      :align: center
      :alt: Example sales order for an apple, orange, and banana.

With the |SOS| created, orders now must be grouped into batches. To do so, navigate to the
*Inventory* dashboard and select the operation type card, `Delivery Orders` or `Pick`. Doing so
displays a filtered list of outgoing operations with the :guilabel:`Ready` status, indicating that
all the products in the |SO| are in stock.

.. note::
   Cluster pick batches can be created for outgoing shipments in one, two, or three steps.

.. seealso::
   - :ref:`Delivery in one step <inventory/receipts_delivery_one_step>`
   - :ref:`Delivery in two steps <inventory/receipts_delivery_two_steps>`
   - :ref:`Delivery in three steps <inventory/delivery_three_steps>`

Click the checkbox to the left of the corresponding outgoing operation to begin adding them to the
batch. With the desired pickings selected, click the :guilabel:`⚙️ Actions (gear)` button and select
the :guilabel:`Add to batch` option from the resulting drop-down menu.

.. example::
   To create a cluster batch as shown in the :ref:`example above
   <inventory/misc/cluster_picking/example>`, in a warehouse configured with two-step outgoing
   shipments, the following pick operations are selected:

   - `WH/PICK/00007`: linked to |SO| 88 for one apple and orange.
   - `WH/PICK/00008`: linked to |SO| 89 for one apple and banana.
   - `WH/PICK/00009`: linked to |SO| 90 for one apple, orange, and banana.

   .. image:: cluster_picking/select-picks.png
      :align: center
      :alt: Use *Add to batch* button, from the *Action* button's list.

Doing so opens an :guilabel:`Add to batch` pop-up window, wherein the employee
:guilabel:`Responsible` for the picking can be assigned.

Choose from the two radio options to add to :guilabel:`an existing batch transfer` or create
:guilabel:`a new batch transfer`.

To begin with a draft, select the :guilabel:`Draft` checkbox.

Conclude the process by clicking :guilabel:`Confirm`.

Process batches
===============

To process batches, navigate to :menuselection:`Inventory app --> Operations --> Batch Transfers`.
Click on a batch to select it.

In the :guilabel:`Detailed Operations` tab, products that are to be picked are grouped by location.

Under the :guilabel:`Source Package` or :guilabel:`Destination Package` field, enter the package
used for the picking.

.. note::
   Use the :guilabel:`Source Package` field when the picking package is configured as *reusable* on
   the :ref:`package form <inventory/misc/create-package>`. This means that the products are
   temporarily placed in a container during picking before getting transferred to their final
   shipping container.

   Alternatively, use the :guilabel:`Destination Package` field when the product is directly placed
   in its *disposable* shipping container during picking.

.. example::
   Process the cluster batch for the three orders of apples, oranges, and bananas :ref:`example
   <inventory/misc/cluster_picking/example>` by assigning each picking to a dedicated package.

   At the storage location for apples, `WH/Stock/Shelf A`, assign the apples in all three pickings
   to one of the three disposable packages, `CLUSTER-PACK-1`, `CLUSTER-PACK-2`, and
   `CLUSTER-PACK-3`.

   Record this in Odoo using the :guilabel:`Destination Package` field in the
   :guilabel:`Detailed Operations` tab.

In Barcode
----------

To process cluster pickings directly from *Barcode*, select the :guilabel:`Batch Transfers` button
from the *Barcode* dashboard. Then, select the desired card for the batch.

In the batch transfer screen, the products in the picking are grouped by location, and each line is
color-coded to associate products in the same picking together.

Then, follow the prompt to :guilabel:`Scan the source location` barcode for the storage location the
first product is located at. Then, scan the barcode for the product and package to process the
transfer. Repeat this for all products and click the :guilabel:`Validate` button.

.. example::

   .. list-table::
      :header-rows: 1
      :stub-columns: 1

      * -
        -
      * - Begin processing the cluster picking by going to the first storage location, `Shelf A` and
          scan the :ref:`location barcode <barcode/setup/location>`. Doing so highlights all the
          pickings that need products from this particular location.

          Scan the barcode for the apple, which highlights the picking labeled in red for the product
          `Apple` at for the picking, `WH/PICK/00007`.

          Then, scan the `CLUSTER-PACK-1` package barcode, and place the product in the designated
          package.

.. tip::
   After assigning a package to a picking, Odoo suggests scanning the same package by displaying the
   package name under another product related to the picking.
