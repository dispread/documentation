Three-step manufacturing
========================

.. |BOM| replace:: :abbr:`BoM (Bill of Materials)`

Odoo *Manufacturing* allows users to manufacture products using one, two, or three steps. When using
three-step manufacturing, Odoo creates a pick components transfer, a manufacturing order, and a
store finished product transfer.

.. tip::
   The number of steps used in manufacturing is set at the warehouse level, allowing for each
   warehouse to use a different number of steps. To change the number of steps used for a specific
   warehouse, begin by navigating to :menuselection:`Inventory --> Configuration --> Warehouses`,
   then select a warehouse from the :guilabel:`Warehouses` screen.

   On the :guilabel:`Warehouse Configuration` tab, find the :guilabel:`Manufacture` radio input field
   and select one of the three options: :guilabel:`Manufacture (1 step)`, :guilabel:`Pick components
   and then manufacture (2 steps)`, or :guilabel:`Pick components, manufacture and then store
   products (3 steps)`.

.. important::
   Products must be properly configured before they can be manufactured in Odoo. For details on how
   to do so, see the documentation on how to :ref:`configure a product for manufacturing
   <manufacturing/management/configure-manufacturing-product>`.

Create manufacturing order
==========================

To manufacture a product in Odoo *Manufacturing*, begin by navigating to
:menuselection:`Manufacturing --> Operations --> Manufacturing Orders`, then click :guilabel:`New`
to create a new manufacturing order.

On the new manufacturing order, select the product to be produced from the :guilabel:`Product`
drop-down menu. The :guilabel:`Bill of Material` field auto-populates with the associated Bill of
Materials (BoM).

If a product has more than one |BOM| configured for it, the specific |BOM| can be selected in the
:guilabel:`Bill of Material` field, and the :guilabel:`Product` field auto-populates with the
associated product.

After a |BOM| has been selected, the :guilabel:`Components` and :guilabel:`Work Orders` tabs
auto-populate with the components and operations specified on the |BOM|. If additional components or
operations are required for the manufacturing order being configured, add them to the
:guilabel:`Components` and :guilabel:`Work Orders` tabs by clicking :guilabel:`Add a line`.

Finally, click :guilabel:`Confirm` to confirm the manufacturing order.

Process pick components transfer
================================

After confirming a three-step manufacturing order, a :guilabel:`Transfers` smart button appears at
the top of the page. Click it to be taken to the :guilabel:`Transfers` page for the manufacturing
order. The page will list two transfers: *WH/PC/XXXXX* (the pick components transfer), and
*WH/SFP/XXXXX* (the store finished products transfer).

Select :guilabel:`WH/PC/XXXXX` to open the pick components transfer for the manufacturing order.
This transfer is used to track the movement of components from the locations where they are stored
to the location where they are used to manufacture the product.

After transferring the components out of their storage location, click :guilabel:`Validate` at the
top of the transfer, followed by :guilabel:`Apply` on the :guilabel:`Immediate Transfer?` pop-up
window that appears. Doing so moves the transfer to the :guilabel:`Done` stage and updates inventory
counts to reflect the quantity of components transferred.

Finally, return to the manufacturing order by clicking the :guilabel:`WH/MO/XXXXX` bread crumb at
the top of the page.

Process manufacturing order
===========================

A manufacturing order is processed by completing all of the work orders listed under its
:guilabel:`Work Orders` tab. This can be done on the manufacturing order itself, or from the work
order tablet view.

Basic workflow
--------------

To complete work orders from the manufacturing order itself, begin by navigating to
:menuselection:`Manufacturing --> Operations --> Manufacturing Orders`, then select a manufacturing
order.

On the manufacturing order page, select the :guilabel:`Work Orders` tab. Once work begins on the
first operation that needs to be completed, click the :guilabel:`Start` button for that operation.
Odoo *Manufacturing* then starts a timer that keeps track of how long the operation takes to
complete.

When the operation is completed, click the :guilabel:`Done` button for that operation. Repeat the
same process for each operation listed on the :guilabel:`Work Orders` tab.

After completing all of the operations, click :guilabel:`Produce All` at the top of the screen to
mark the manufacturing order as :guilabel:`Done` and register the manufactured product(s) into
inventory.

Tablet view workflow
--------------------

To complete the work orders for a manufacturing order using the tablet view, begin by navigating to
:menuselection:`Manufacturing --> Operations --> Manufacturing Orders`, then select a manufacturing
order.

Next, click on the :guilabel:`Work Orders` tab, then select the :guilabel:`tablet view` button on
the line of the first operation that will be processed. This opens the tablet view.

.. image:: three_step_manufacturing/tablet-view-button.png
   :align: center
   :alt: The tablet view button for a work order on a manufacturing order.

After opening the tablet view, Odoo *Manufacturing* automatically starts a timer to keep track of
how long the operation takes to complete. After completing the operation, click the :guilabel:`Mark
as Done` button in the top right of the tablet view.

.. image:: three_step_manufacturing/mark-as-done.png
   :align: center
   :alt: The Mark as Done button in the manufacturing tablet view.

Clicking :guilabel:`Mark as Done` while there is at least one more operation left to complete will
open a page that lists the next operation. Click on that operation to open it in the tablet view.

Once the final operation for the manufacturing order has been reached, a :guilabel:`Mark as Done and
Close MO` button will appear on the tablet view in addition to the :guilabel:`Mark as Done` button.
Click :guilabel:`Mark as Done and Close MO` to mark the manufacturing order as :guilabel:`Done` and
register the manufactured product(s) into inventory.

It is also possible to complete the final operation while keeping the manufacturing order open, by
clicking :guilabel:`Mark as Done`. In this case, the manufacturing order can be closed at a later
time by clicking the :guilabel:`Produce All` button on the order.

Process finished product transfer
=================================

After completing the manufacturing order, return to the order's :guilabel:`Transfers` page by
clicking the :guilabel:`Transfers` button at the top of the order. This time, select
:guilabel:`WH/SFP/XXXXX` to open the store finished products transfer. This transfer is used to
track the movement of finished products from the location where they were manufactured to the
location where they are stored.

After transferring the finished products to their storage location, click :guilabel:`Validate` at
the top of the transfer, followed by :guilabel:`Apply` on the :guilabel:`Immediate Transfer?` pop-up
window that appears. Doing so moves the transfer to the :guilabel:`Done` stage and updates inventory
counts to reflect the quantity of finished products transferred.
