Odoo's *Product Lifecycle Management (PLM)* app simplifies the management of the revision history of
bills of materials (BoMs).

Odoo *PLM* can be used to access previous |BOM| versions, assembly instructions, component details,
and past product design files. |BOM| effective dates are recorded for error tracking, and changes
are compartmentalized in an :ref:`engineering change order <plm/eco>`, which makes merging |ECOs|
back to the production |BOM| simple.

Current BoM version
===================

To see the current version of the |BOM| used in production, go to :menuselection:`PLM app --> Master
Data --> Bill of Materials`, and select the desired |BOM| from the list. Then, switch to the
:guilabel:`Miscellaneous` tab, where the currently live :guilabel:`Version` of the |BOM| is
displayed.

.. note::
   |BOMs| can also be accessed from :menuselection:`Manufacturing app --> Products --> Bill of
   Materials`.

Version history
===============

As long as the *PLM* app is installed, all |ECOs| linked to a |BOM| can be viewed, by clicking the
:guilabel:`ECO` smart button on a |BOM|.

Click the :guilabel:`≣ (four horizontal lines)` icon to switch to the list view.

In the list of |ECOs|, navigate to the search bar, and click the :guilabel:`▼ (down arrow)` icon to
access a drop-down menu of :guilabel:`Filters`.

Next, filter by :guilabel:`Done` |ECOs| to view: the revision history of the |BOM|, the
:guilabel:`Responsible` user who applied the change, and the :guilabel:`Effective Date` of the
|BOM|.

Click each |ECO| to view the past components, operations, and design files associated with the
|BOM|.

.. note::
   If the :guilabel:`Effective Date` field is empty, the :guilabel:`Effective` date of the |ECO| is
   automatically set to :guilabel:`As soon as possible` and no dates are recorded in the revision
   history of the |BOM|.

.. tip::
   A workaround for checking when the |BOM| went live is by navigating to the chatter, and hovering
   over the time the |ECO| was moved to the :ref:`closing stage <plm/eco/stage-config>`.

Design files
============

Attach computer-aided design (CAD) files, PDFs, images, or other design material to the |BOM|
itself.

To do so, navigate to :menuselection:`PLM app --> Master Data --> Bill of Materials`, and select the
desired |BOM|. On the |BOM|, navigate to the *chatter*, and click the :guilabel:`📎 (paperclip)`
icon.

The files associated with the |BOM| are displayed in the :guilabel:`Files` section. To add more
design files, select the :guilabel:`Attach files` button.

Manage design files in an ECO
-----------------------------

After creating a :ref:`new Engineering Change Order <plm/eco/create-eco>` (ECO), all files stored in
the :guilabel:`Files` section of the |BOM| are automatically copied over to the
:guilabel:`Documents` smart button. Click on the button to open the :guilabel:`Attachments` page.

Hover over each attachment to reveal the :guilabel:`︙ (three vertical dots)` icon. From there,
choose whether to :guilabel:`Edit`, :guilabel:`Remove`, or :guilabel:`Download` the file. Any
changes made to these files are contained within the |ECO|, and will only apply to the production
|BOM| once the :ref:`changes are applied <plm/eco/apply-changes>`.

.. example::
   Replace the keyboard PDF in an active |ECO|, by first selecting the :guilabel:`Documents` smart
   button.

   .. image:: version_control/documents-smart-button.png
      :align: center
      :alt: Show *Documents* smart button from an active ECO.

   On the :guilabel:`Attachments` page, hover over the design file, and click the :guilabel:`︙
   (three vertical dots)` icon. Then, click the :guilabel:`Edit` option.

   Next, rename the file something specific to express why the file is about to be archived in this
   active |ECO|. In this case, the |BOM| is for a smaller keyboard, so the manual for a larger
   keyboard is no longer relevant. So, rename `100% keyboard manual`, and :guilabel:`Save` the
   change.

   Next, click back to the :guilabel:`Attachments` page, using the breadcrumbs. Click on the
   :guilabel:`︙ (three vertical dots)` icon again, and then select the :guilabel:`Remove` option to
   archive the file.

   Next, click the :guilabel:`Upload` button to upload the new design file, named `60% keyboard
   manual`.

      :alt: View of *Attachments* page from the *Documents* smart button. Displays one archived and
            one newly added attachment.

.. note::
   Archived files are **not** permanently deleted — they can still be accessed in the previous
   |ECO|, or as an archived file in the latest |ECO|, where the archival occurred.

Apply rebase
============

Odoo simplifies the process of merging different versions of a |BOM| when multiple |ECOs| are open
for the same product.

If the |BOM| used in production is updated, while an |ECO| is still open (and in testing), review
the differences between the production |BOMs| in the newly appeared :guilabel:`Previous Eco Bom
Changes` tab.

Then, click the :guilabel:`Apply Rebase` button to update the |BOM|, and make it cohesive with the
production |BOM|.

.. example::
   Two |ECOs|, `ECO0011` and `ECO0012`, are created when the current |BOM| version is `5`. In
   `ECO0011`, a new component, `Space stabilizer`, is added, and the changes are applied. This means
   the current |BOM| version has become `6`.

   .. image:: version_control/branch-change.png
      :align: center
      :alt: Apply changes to an ECO to update the production BOM.

   This means `ECO0012`'s |BOM| is missing the `Space stabilizer`, as shown in the
   :guilabel:`Previous Eco Bom Changes` tab.

   To ensure the changes applied by `ECO0011` are kept when the changes occur in `ECO0012`, click
   the :guilabel:`Apply Rebase` button to apply the previous |ECO| changes, without affecting the
   changes already made to `ECO0012`.
